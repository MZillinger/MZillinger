# Hi, I’m Maximilian Zillinger

I am a PhD student in theoretical particle physics, working on numerical methods and
high-performance scientific code. My research focuses on precision calculations for the muon g-2. In particular I worked on the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering contribution to muon $g-2$.

I am particularly interested in the interface between
- analytical theory,
- numerical algorithms
- efficient implementations in various programming languages.
