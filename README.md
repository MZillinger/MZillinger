# Hi, I’m Maximilian Zillinger

I am a PhD student in theoretical particle physics, working on numerical methods and
high-performance scientific code. My research focuses on precision calculations for the muon g-2.

I am particularly interested in the interface between
- analytical theory,
- numerical algorithms, and
- efficient implementations in various programming languages.
